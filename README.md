# Hello-World
Just a new repository
Hi Henry:
This is the first Github account that your dad created for you in 2018. Since you're still a kid and can't read English, I'll keep this account working untill you grow up. I wish you could be the happiest child in this world, choose the life favors you most and married with the best girl that you loved. If someday you become a programmer, I hope you could see this text file.
